## Focused on Teaching 5 Core Financial Concepts

**Target:** 60-90 second sessions that teach real money lessons through consequences.

---

## 🎓 The 5 Core Concepts We Teach

### 1\. **Overborrowing is Dangerous** 💳❌

**Lesson:** Debt spirals destroy financial freedom  
**Demo:** Borrow 3 times \= Game Over (debt trap)  
**Metrics:** Times borrowed, interest paid, days in debt  
**Success:** Win with 0-1 borrows

### 2\. **Delayed Gratification Wins** ⏱️✨

**Lesson:** Saying "no" now gets you what you want faster  
**Demo:** Skip invites → reach goal faster  
**Metrics:** Invites joined vs skipped, days to goal  
**Success:** High skip rate, low days to goal

### 3\. **Every Dollar Has Opportunity Cost** 💰🎯

**Lesson:** Spending on X means you can't spend on Y (your goal)  
**Demo:** Every purchase slows goal progress  
**Metrics:** Total earned vs spent, savings rate %  
**Success:** Earned \> Spent

### 4\. **Earning Beats Borrowing** 💪 \> 💳

**Lesson:** Hustling builds wealth, borrowing destroys it  
**Demo:** Compare hustle earnings vs interest paid  
**Metrics:** Times hustled vs borrowed, net cash flow  
**Success:** More hustles than borrows

### 5\. **Social Pressure Costs Real Money** 👥💸

**Lesson:** FOMO is expensive, boundaries matter  
**Demo:** Maintain social while protecting cash (balance)  
**Metrics:** Social score vs goal progress  
**Success:** Social 40+ AND goal achieved

## 🎮 Simplified Action Set (4 Actions Only)

Removed: Counter Plan, Delay (too complex for demo)

### **1\. Join** ✓

- **When:** Accept the invite as-is  
- **Effect:**  
  - Cash: \-Full Cost (triggers auto-borrow if needed)  
  - Energy: \-1 to \-2  
  - Social: \+3 to \+5  
  - Goal: Slows significantly  
- **Teaches:** Instant gratification, opportunity cost, can cause debt spiral  
- **Available:** Always (may trigger borrowing)

### **2\. Split Cost** ⚡

- **When:** Share cost with squad  
- **Effect:**  
  - Cash: \-Half Cost (triggers auto-borrow if needed)  
  - Energy: \-1  
  - Social: \+2 to \+3  
  - Goal: Slows moderately  
- **Teaches:** Compromise, still spends money, reduces but doesn't eliminate cost  
- **Available:** Always (may trigger borrowing)

### **3\. Skip** ✕

- **When:** Say no, protect your goal  
- **Effect:**  
  - Cash: $0 (saved\!)  
  - Energy: $0 (preserved\!)  
  - Social: \-2 to \-4  
  - Goal: Protected (no slowdown)  
- **Teaches:** Delayed gratification, opportunity cost in reverse, social tradeoff  
- **Available:** Always

### **4\. Earn First** 💰

- **When:** Hustle before deciding  
- **Effect:**  
  - Cash: \+$8 to $12  
  - Energy: \-1 (hustle takes energy)  
  - Social: \-1 (busy, can't respond quickly)  
  - Goal: Speeds up if you save the money  
- **Teaches:** Earning beats borrowing, building wealth vs debt  
- **Available:** Always

## 📊 Simplified Meters

### 4 Core Meters:

1. **Cash** \- Current money available (starts $50)  
2. **Energy** \- 0 to 3 bars per day (limits actions)  
3. **Social** \- 0 to 100 (affects invite quality)  
4. **Goal Progress** \- Cash balance shows progress toward goal

### Debt Display:

- Not a meter, shown as warning notices  
- "Debt: $X per day for Y days remaining"  
- "⚠️ Borrow count: 2/3 (Game ends at 3\!)"

---

## 🎯 Core Gameplay Loop

### Daily Flow:

1. **Start Day** \- Energy refills to 3  
2. **Invite Appears** \- 2-4 invites per day  
3. **Choose Action** \- 4 buttons (Join, Split, Skip, Earn)  
4. **Outcome Plays** \- Meters update, squad reacts  
5. **Callout Shows** \- Educational moment  
6. **Next Invite or Day**  
7. **Check Win/Loss** \- Did you reach goal or borrow 3x?

### Win Conditions:

- **Success:** Cash ≥ Goal Amount ($200-$400)

## 🎯 Success Metrics (for Demo/MVP)

1. **Tries again after debt trap** \- Learns borrowing is dangerous  
2. **Increases skip rate** \- Learns delayed gratification  
3. **Hustles more** \- Learns earning beats borrowing  
4. **Reaches goal faster** \- Applies all concepts  
5. **Balances social & money** \- Real-world applicable

### Data to Track:

- Borrow count per session  
- Skip rate per session  
- Days to goal per session  
- Improvement across sessions  
- Which concept caused failure most

## 🚀 MVP Scope

### In Scope:

✅ 4 actions (Join, Split, Skip, Earn)  
✅ Auto-borrowing with interest  
✅ 3-borrow game over  
✅ Financial report card with 5 concepts  
✅ 25 invites total  
✅ Goal collection system  
✅ Session time: 60-90 seconds  
✅ Surprise events (10 types, teaches emergency planning)  
✅ Advanced goals (12+ goals across 4 tiers)

### Out of Scope (for now):

❌ Delay action (similar to Skip)  
❌ Squad chat

---

## 💥 Surprise Events (In Scope)

**Purpose:** Teach that life has unexpected costs \- planning for them matters

### Event Triggers:

- **Frequency:** 20-30% chance after Join/Split actions  
- **Weighted by:** High spending behavior increases frequency

### Event Types (10 total):

{

  title: "Streaming Auto-Renewed",

  desc: "Your music subscription charged $10",

  cost: 10

},

{

  title: "Parking Ticket",

  desc: "Forgot to pay for parking. Fine: $15",

  cost: 15

},

{

  title: "Phone Data Overage", 

  desc: "You went over your data limit",

  cost: 8

}

### Player Options:

1. **Pay Now** \- Deduct from cash (may trigger auto-borrow)  
2. **Borrow** \- Explicit borrow (counts toward 3-borrow limit\!)

**Teaching Moment:** Surprise costs demonstrate:

- **Concept 1:** Unexpected expenses force borrowing  
- **Concept 3:** Need cash buffer for emergencies  
- **Concept 4:** Earning creates cushion vs borrowing
